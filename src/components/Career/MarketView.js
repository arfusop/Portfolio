            My first job out of college, this was a 70/30 split of non coding
            based and coding based work. Programmed and administered online
            surveys from multiple clients. Used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to add
            custom layouts & styling to each survey as required per theme
            provided. Used SQL & Microsoft Access to collect, store, and test
            the data from each survey to confirm data accuracy and integrity.{' '}
